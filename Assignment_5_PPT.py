#Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array

#You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

#The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

#Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

    return []
      
ans = []
for i in range(0, m*n, n):
    ans.append(original[i:i+n])
